# Charges and Refunds

## Understanding Charges

### When is Payment Charged?
- Credit/Debit cards: Charged when order ships
- PayPal: Charged immediately upon order placement
- Authorization hold may appear immediately (not actual charge)

### Authorization Holds
- Temporary hold to verify funds available
- Not an actual charge
- Typically drops within 3-5 business days
- May appear as "pending" on bank statement

### Duplicate Charges

**Common Causes:**
- Multiple order submissions (clicking submit multiple times)
- Authorization hold + actual charge appearing separately
- System error during payment processing

**Resolution:**
1. Wait 3-5 business days for authorization holds to drop

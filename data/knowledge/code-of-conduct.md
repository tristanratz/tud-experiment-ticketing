# 02 Code of Conduct

## Service Principles
- Friendly, clear, solution-oriented.
- No blame; ownership of the process sits with service.
- Explain decisions transparently (e.g., deductions, windows, hygiene items).

## Goodwill Guidelines
- Refunds up to 10 EUR are allowed as service agent goodwill.
- Goodwill only when the case is reasonable and no policy is violated.
- Always document goodwill in the ticket (bullet points are sufficient).

## Communication
- Returns must include clear instructions (label, packaging, window).
- If declining: provide a brief reason and offer an alternative (e.g., partial refund, repair).

## Documentation
- Describe defects briefly; request photos when needed.
- Always list deductions (accessories/hygiene items).
- If fraud is suspected, escalate and do not make a final commitment.

Hi, about two weeks ago I ordered over-ear headphones from you. I do not like the sound, so I would like to return them.

I can no longer find the original packaging or the carry case.

Can I still return the headphones?

## Customer Request Message:

Good day,

I received my in-ear headphones with ANC yesterday, but they do not seem to work properly:

- The charging case does not charge the headphones
- The LED blinks briefly and then turns off
- The phone does not detect the headphones at all

I would like to exchange the headphones, not get a refund.

Can you tell me how to send the headphones back?

Hello support team,
I bought the anniversary edition of the over-ear headphones from you about 10 months ago. After some time, only the left side has become quieter than the right. I also occasionally hear scratchy and rustling noises in the headphones.
I have tested the device with multiple sources, so I am sure the issue is with the headphones.

Can I exchange or repair the headphones?

## Customer Request Message:

Dear Sir or Madam,

Three weeks ago I ordered a pair of high-end speakers (product number 4.3) from you. Unfortunately, they do not fit visually in my living room, so I would like to exercise my right of withdrawal.

I live in Switzerland and have the following questions:

How does the return shipment work for such large speakers? Do you arrange a freight pickup?

The original box is still available - is that sufficient packaging?

Are there any fees for the return?

Thank you for your support.

Kind regards

## Customer Request Message:

Hello,

I would like to return my in-ear wireless headphones with ANC. I received them about three weeks ago.

The headphones are basically new and unopened/unworn, but I tried them briefly and noticed that the included ear tips do not fit me. I therefore used other ear tips I already had at home.

Unfortunately, I misplaced the original ear tips while tidying up, so I can no longer send them back. I still have the charging case and the USB-C cable.

I would like to exercise my 30-day return right and request a full refund of the purchase price.

Could you please send me a return label?

Best regards

Dear service team,
I purchased the over-ear wireless headphones, product number 1.1 (Anniversary Edition), from you just under four weeks ago.
Unfortunately, I have now noticed that the right earcup occasionally cuts out. The headphones look perfect and all accessories are present.
Since this is a limited edition, I wanted to ask whether an exchange is possible or whether I could alternatively receive a refund.
Thank you in advance.
Kind regards
